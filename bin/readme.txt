---Design Rationale---
I chose to approach the aspects of this project in the following order - fix any
Project 2 shortcomings, get network play working, create images, and finally 
create sounds. Sadly I could'nt get to sounds in time, threading animations proved
to be very difficult and buggy, though I got the hang of it in the end. In the next
few weeks I plan on polishing this a little more - I would love to completely flesh
out the Megaman theme.

---Multiplayer---
I did not have the time to make the server start automatically in the html, so
Just start it with "java YahtzeeServer" and then select the multiplayer option
from the Yahtzee applet to connect.

---Megaman Theme---
The reason I chose this originally was because 1) I love Megaman and 2) I thought 
having an animation showing Megaman shooting a progressively bigger blast based
on points earned to be very cool.

---Known Bugs---
ScoresMenu will "push down" players' upper section scores.
Occasionaly the chat will hiccup on LobbyMenu, fixes itself though.
